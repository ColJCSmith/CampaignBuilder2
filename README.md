# Campaign Builder

## Description
2020 brought problems and challenges that no one could have foreseen. This is especially true for the charities who support Australia’s most vulnerable people. Whether it’s drought, bushfires or COVID, each development brings a new set of needs for a different group. And with money tight for everyone, donors are pulling back on everything but the most relevant causes. Charities are not web developers, and struggle to keep their content and campaigns relevant.<br>
CampaignBuilder is an app that enables anyone to build a microsite for a new cause. By completing a simple form, any user can build a new campaign for the charity. On the homepage, the user answers a series of questions about the cause. From here, they can search for and select relevant case studies, and set up a recommended donation.<br>
Think GoFundMe for Charities

## Motivation

Campaign Builder was born from conversations with charities including UNICEF Australia, Beyond Blue and the NSW Rural Fire Service Donation Fund.
A big problem for all these charities is relevance.  2020 brought so many issues, that they struggle to keep their audiences informed and engaged.  This is because:
<ul>Websites are tricky and time consuming to update.</ul>
<ul>Content is difficult to find and share.</ul>
<ul>Audiences are hard to reach and target effectively.</ul>
In summary, legacy technology is making it hard for charities to build campaigns and help people in need.
